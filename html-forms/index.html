            <h2>Coffee Basics</h2>
            <p>
              Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the
              seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. It is darkly
              colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in
              humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries and is one
              of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and
              presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press,
              caff√® latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a
              popular alternative.

            <h3>Dates back to 800 A.D.</h3>
            <p>
              Legend has it that 9th-century goat herders noticed the effect
              caffeine had on their goats, who appeared to "dance" after eating
              the fruit of the Coffea plant. A local monk then made a drink with
              the produce and found that it kept him awake at night, thus the
              original cup of coffee was born.

            />
            <h3>Technically seeds</h3>
            <p>
              Coffee beans are technically seeds. They're the pits of the
              cherry-like berries found on the flowering shrubs, but we call
              them "beans" because of the resemblance to legumes.

            <h3>Banned in the past</h3>
            <p>
              Back in 1511, leaders in Mecca believed it stimulated radical
              thinking and outlawed the drink. Some 16th-century Italian
              clergymen also tried to ban coffee because they believed it to be
              "satanic." However, Pope Clement VII loved coffee so much that he
              lifted the ban and had coffee baptized in 1600.
